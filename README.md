# INVERTER-DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-USING-SKY130PDK

## CMOS inverter schematic and layout design and analysis utilizing the sky130 pdk and numerous open source tools

This project has only one goal: to experiment with the operation of an inverter and to comprehend all of its parameters. The design will make use of the models included with the skywater 130nm pdk along withÂ numerous open source tools such as Xschem, NGSPICE, MAGIC, Netgen, and so on.
